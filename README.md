# Covid-Tracker

This application displays various data values to display Covid-19 statistics by country. The application pulls real time data from a Covid-19 API and lists the country's confirmed cases, daths, and total number of recovered individuals. 

This project implemented React, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. This project helped me develop skills in React, JavaScript and was an introduction to Bootstrap!
